# Quno/Infinite Calendar

Quno/Infinite Calendar owns virtualized horizontal and vertical schedules, timestamped events, async loading, event
rendering, creation and movement, navigation, zoom, and visual focus.

`getDayProps` assigns date-wide presentation to a complete day and its visible header. `getDayCellProps`
adds resource-specific classes, inline styles, or titles from typed date, weekend, calendar, and orientation context.
`getHourProps` styles clock-hour bands and their visible labels across both orientations. Together they style
days, hours, horizontal rows, and vertical columns without taking ownership of geometry or interaction behavior.

Day keys use shared timezone-free `IsoDate` values. Event `start` and `end` remain timestamp strings and retain their
local or offset semantics.

`CalendarEvent.kind` identifies an appointment, availability, or blocker. Availability is a foreground event by
default, so it can be selected and contributes to overlap sizing. Set `renderLayer: "availability"` only when a
consumer needs the background treatment; that layer has independent overlap lanes and may grow the resource.

The horizontal navigation handle can reveal a resource row with
`scrollToDateTime({ date, time, calendarId })`. The calendar owns the virtual-row wait and viewport correction; consumers
do not query its DOM.

The field guide keeps its interaction contracts live: newly scrolled dates populate without a simulated delay, event
cards can be resized in place, parent-reviewed mutations preserve their working row and restore the original view on
Cancel, Date Input arrow changes navigate immediately, and motion begins from an explicit draft action. An external
create draft with no participants keeps the normal calendar set and drawn date visible while its unassigned preview
and Save action remain unavailable.

TanStack Virtual notifications use its queued React update path. Layout restoration requests an ordinary React
projection before paint, keeping React 19 development free of the virtualizer `flushSync` lifecycle warning while
semantic anchor and frame-stability browser coverage continues to guard against empty intermediate views.

Foreground events and explicitly background-layered availability have independent deterministic collision lanes. A resource grows to the greater layer
depth, not the sum, so foreground events remain overlaid on background availability while overlapping background availability stays readable in
both orientations. Pointer-move hit-testing and preview publication are limited to the latest position per display
frame; release still flushes the final position synchronously.

Untouched date buckets keep stable immutable snapshots, and prepared date/resource layers are reused until their
bucket, resource selection, visible time bounds, or relevant draft source changes.

## Bundle budget

JavaScript is limited to 50 KiB gzip and the optional stylesheet to 2 KiB gzip. The current artifacts measure
37.90 KiB and 1.95 KiB gzip respectively (Node 24). See [Decision 094](./decisions.md#094---allow-50-kib-for-infinite-calendar-javascript).

## Named contracts

Use `renderEvent`, component-level `locale` and `formatters.dayLabel({ date, locale })`, plus `getDayProps`,
`getDayCellProps`, and `getHourProps` for presentation. Navigation commands and zoom notifications use named objects.
